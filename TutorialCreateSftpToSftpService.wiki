#summary Tutorial on how to create a one way Service based on the SFTP transport.

=Introduction=

This tutorial will help you to get started with a one-way service that consumes a file over SFTP, transform it and produce an outgoing file again using SFTP.

The generated code includes error handling that:
 * Verifying that the file is stable, no one is writing to it
 * Renaming the file before consuming it to avoid that two threads start to consume one and the same file
 * Saving the file to a local archive before processing its content, e.g transforming it.
 * Sending files to a separate name avoiding that the receiving application starts to consume the file before it is completely sent.
 * Duplication detection, either overwrite, add seq-no or throw an exception
 * Manual routine for restart sending the file, either from original sender or from Mule.
 * Logging of central SFPT events, such as get, put, rename, delete and any errors that might occur

*NOTE*: Prerequisites for this tutorial are:
 * The tutorial [TutorialCreateIntegrationComponent Create a new Integration Component] is completed (and that the SFTP transport was selected) 
 * The installation guide regarding [InstallationGuide#Setup_of_public_key_cryptography_for_the_SFTP_transport Setup of public key cryptography for the SFTP transport] is completed

=Create a SFTP to SFTP service=

 * Select the menu "File --> New --> Other" and expand the wizard "SOI Toolkit Code Generator"
 * Select the code generator "Create a new service"

 * Click on the "Next >" button
 * The wizard "SOI Toolkit - Create a new service" opens up
  * Select the message exchange pattern "One Way"
  * Select the inbound transport "SFTP"
  * Select the outbound transport "SFTP"
  * Select your service project using the "Browse..." button, e.g. "/mySample-services"
  * Set a proper service-name, e.g. mySampleSftpService

 * Click on the "Finish" button
  * The wizard now starts to generate files and refresh the workspace.

 * When the wizard is done you can find the files for your new service in the Eclipse Package Explorer

 * Files of interest:
  * Source folder {{{src/test/java}}}
  A new package is created for the service {{{org.sample.mysample.mysamplesftpservice}}} with two Java-classes.
  {{{MySampleSftpServiceIntegrationTest.java}}} contains some unit tests for the service that you can use as a start.
  {{{MySampleSftpServiceTestReceiver.java}}} contains a teststub receiver that you can use as a start.
  * Source folder {{{src/test/resources}}}
  The folder {{{teststub-services}}} contains the file {{{MySampleSftpService-teststub-service.xml}}} that is a teststub service that you can use as a start.
  * Source folder {{{src/main/java}}}
  A new package is created for the service {{{org.sample.mysample.mysamplesftpservice}}} with one Java-class.
  {{{MySampleSftpServiceTransformer.java}}} contains a sample transformation that you can use as a start.
  * Source folder {{{src/main/resources}}}
  The folder {{{services}}} contains the file {{{MySampleSftpService-service.xml}}} that contains the actual definition of the new service. 
  * Source folder {{{src/environment}}}
  The configuration file {{{mySample-config.properties}}} has got the following properties added:
 {{{
# Properties for sftp-service "mySampleSftpService"
# TODO: Update to reflect your settings
MYSAMPLESFTPSERVICE_SENDER_SFTP_ADDRESS=muletest1@localhost/~/sftp/mysamplesftpservice/sender
MYSAMPLESFTPSERVICE_SENDER_POLLING_MS=1000
MYSAMPLESFTPSERVICE_SENDER_SIZECHECK_MS=500
MYSAMPLESFTPSERVICE_RECEIVER_SFTP_ADDRESS=muletest1@localhost/~/sftp/mysamplesftpservice/receiver
MYSAMPLESFTPSERVICE_ARCHIVE_FOLDER=/Users/magnuslarsson/archive
MYSAMPLESFTPSERVICE_ARCHIVE_RESTART_POLLING_MS=1000
 }}}
  * The configuration file {{{mySample-security.properties}}} contains since the creation fo the integration component the properties:
 {{{
# Properties for the default sftp-connector
# TODO: Update to reflect your settings
SOITOOLKIT_SFTP_IDENTITYFILE=/Users/magnuslarsson/.ssh/id_dsa
SOITOOLKIT_SFTP_IDENTITYFILE_PASSPHRASE=yourPassphrase
 }}}

 * Run unit tests
  * Right-click the test-class {{{MySampleJmsServiceIntegrationTest.java}}} and select "Run As" --> "JUnit Test"
  The tests runs and its success are reported in the JUnit view:

  The Console view displays at the same time log-messages from the execution:

  NOTE: Take a look at the unit test code and the transformer code for a better understanding on what is going on :-)

 * Run tests manually
 Sometimes just running unit tests are not sufficient so it is a good idea to know how to perform manual tests locally in your own PC.
  * Right-click on the test-server {{{MySampleMuleServer.java}}} in package {{{org/sample/mysample}}} in source folder {{{src/test/java}}} and select "Run As --> Java Application"
  * Copy a file with ok content (e.g. "AAA") to the {{{sender}}} folder and watch the console and the {{{archive}}} folder.
  NOTE: The {{{receiver}}}-folder will never contain any files for a long period since the teststub-service picks them up from there :-)
  * Copy a file with incorrect content (e.g. "ERROR") to the {{{sender}}} folder and watch the console and the {{{archive/invalid}}} folder.
  NOTE: The {{{receiver}}}-folder will never contain any file since the teststub-service picks it up from there :-)
