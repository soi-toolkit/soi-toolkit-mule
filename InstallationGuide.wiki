#summary Installation Guide for users of soi-toolkit.

*Content*
<wiki:toc max_depth="3" />

= Introduction =

To get started with soi-toolkit and Mule ESB you only need to install Java SE, Eclipse, Maven and the soi-toolkit Eclipse plugin. See section [#Required_installations Required installations] for instructions.

Depending on your needs you also might want to install some optional tools in your development environment such as Subversion clients, test tool for Web Services, soapUI, or setting up PKI - keys for usage with the SFTP transport. See section [#Optional_installations Optional installations] for instructions on how to install and configure these optional tools.

The installation guides below assumes your on a 32 bit Microsoft Windows PC.

==Required installations==

The following versions (or newer) are recommended:
|| *Tool* || *Version* ||
||Java SE||6 Update 21||
||Eclipse EE||3.6.1 (Helios)||
||Maven||2.2.1||
||Maven plugin for Eclipse||0.10.0||
||Soi-toolkit plugin for Eclipse||0.1.7||

*Note:* Older version such as Java SE 5 and Eclipse 3.4, 3.5 should work without any problem (even though we don't test against these versions), but we strongly recommend using Maven 2.2.1 or newer since some older versions of Maven are known to produce incorrect GPG signatures and checksums .

===Java SE===
Install Java SE according to the following instructions:

 * Download JDK for Java SE from http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/widget/jdk6.jsp
 A file named {{{jdk-6u21-windows-i586.exe}}} is downloaded to your PC.

 * Execute the downloaded installation program and use default values for the installation of both the JDK and the JRE.

 * Create an environment variable, JAVA_HOME, in Windows that points to the installation directory. 
 E.g. {{{JAVA_HOME=C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_21}}}

 * Add the bin-folder of the JDK to the Windows PATH-environment variable.
 E.g. {{{PATH=...;C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_21\bin}}}

 * Verify the installation in a command window with the commands {{{java –version}}},  {{{javac –version}}} och {{{set JAVA_HOME}}}. The result should be similar to:

 * For full installation instructions see [http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/documentation/install-windows-152927.html Microsoft Windows Installation (32-bit)]

===Eclipse===

Install Eclipse according to the following instructions:

 * Download  {{{Eclipse IDE for Java EE Developers}}} from http://eclipse.org/downloads/.
 A file named {{{eclipse-jee-helios-SR1-win32.zip}}} is downloaded to your computer.

 * Unzip the zip file to the desired installation folder, eg C:\opt.

 * Create a shortcut to the file {{{eclipse.exe}}} (eg {{{C:\opt\eclipse\eclipse.exe}}}) in the installation folder to the desktop.

 * Verify the installation, start Eclipse through the desktop shortcut.
 Enter the desired workspace folder where requested and click on the "Workbench" icon (top right) when the welcome screen is presented. The the Eclipse workbench should be displayed and look like:

===Maven===

Install Maven according to the following instructions:

 * Download Maven from http://maven.apache.org/download.html
 Download the file named {{{apache-maven-2.2.1-bin.zip}}} to your computer.

 * Unzip the zip file to the desired installation folder, eg {{{C:\opt}}}.

 * Create an environment variable, {{{M2_HOME}}}, in Windows pointing out the installation.
 For example: {{{M2_HOME=C:\opt\apache-maven-2.2.1}}}

 * Add Maven's bin folder to the Windows {{{PATH}}} variable.
 For example: {{{PATH=...;C:\opt\apache-maven-2.2.1\bin}}}

 * Verifying the installation of a command window with the command {{{mvn -v}}},
 it should produce a result like:

 * For full installation instructions see http://maven.apache.org/download.html # Installation

===Maven Eclipse plugin===

Install the Maven plugin for Eclipse according to the following instructions:

 * The installation is performed using the Eclipse "Update Site"-mechanism.
 The Update Site is: http://m2eclipse.sonatype.org/sites/m2e.
 
 For full installation instructions see http://m2eclipse.sonatype.org/installing-m2eclipse.html.

 Notes:
  * If the installation asks for approval of certificates, so be sure to select the available certificate before the next step in the installation.
  * Restart the workspace when so requested.

 * To avoid the error message {{{"The Maven Integration requires that Eclipse be running in a JDK, because a number of Maven core plugins are using jars from the JDK. (...)"}}} follow the instructions on the following page [http://tech.karolzielinski.com/m2eclipse-eclipse-is-running-in-a-jre-but-a-jdk-is-required Eclipse is running in a JRE, but a JDK is required]

==Optional installation==

===Installing Apache ActiveMQ===
If you want to be able to perform manuel tests on your PC where JMS is involved it could be a good idea to run these tests with a external JMS provider, i.e. not a JMS provider that is embedded in Mule (as it is when you run unit tests).

Follow these instructions to install ActiveMQ locally on your PC:

 * Download ActiveMQ from http://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.cgi?path=%2Factivemq%2Fapache-activemq%2F5.3.2%2Fapache-activemq-5.3.2-bin.zip

 * Unzip to some folder, e.g. {{{C:\opt}}}

 * Go to the folder {{{C:\opt\apache-activemq-5.3.2\bin\win32}}} and execute the file {{{InstallService.bat}}}.

 Active MQ is now registered as a windows service and can be started automatically when the PC is started.
 Verify that ActiveMQ is running after the installation and start its windows service if not by:

 Open the url http://localhost:8161/admin/index.jsp in a web browser.

 A page like the following should now be displayed:

===Setup of public key cryptography for the SFTP transport===

=!!! Under construction !!!=

When using the SFTP transport it is strongly recommended to not use traditional username/passwords but instead use public key cryptography. See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography for background information.

The instruction below is based on DSA keys but RSA keys can be used as well.

 * Verify proper security settings on files and folders
 Ssh is quit picky on security settings (not unexpected :-) so before trying to create keys verify the following permission settings:
  * home folder: 711
  * folder .ssh: 700
  * file authorized_keys, authorized_keys2: 600
  * private keys (id_dsa,id_rsa): 600
  * public keys (id_dsa.pub,id_rsa.pub): 644
  * Use the chmod command to correct if any of the files or folders are too open, e.g.
{{{
chmod 700 .ssh
}}}

 * Create a pair of private and public keys

  Execute the command {{{ssh-keygen -t dsa}}}, accept default filename and enter a proper passphrase of your selection.

  The files {{{id_dsa}}} and {{{id_dsa.pub}}} are now created in your .ssh - folder.

  NOTE: Never give away your private key {{{id_dsa}}}, only share the public one {{{id_dsa.pub}}}!
{{{
MagnusMac-2:~ magnuslarsson$ ssh-keygen -t dsa
Generating public/private dsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/Users/magnuslarsson/.ssh/id_dsa): 
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): 
Enter same passphrase again: 
Your identification has been saved in /Users/magnuslarsson/.ssh/id_dsa.
Your public key has been saved in /Users/magnuslarsson/.ssh/id_dsa.pub.
The key fingerprint is:
31:de:60:62:de:d0:44:b6:90:b6:b9:60:82:aa:d1:da magnuslarsson@MagnusMac-2.local

MagnusMac-2:~ magnuslarsson$ ls /Users/magnuslarsson/.ssh/id_dsa
/Users/magnuslarsson/.ssh/id_dsa

MagnusMac-2:~ magnuslarsson$ ls /Users/magnuslarsson/.ssh/id_dsa.pub
/Users/magnuslarsson/.ssh/id_dsa.pub
}}} 


 * Copy and activate public key to remote sftp-machines
 To be able to authenticate yourself using your private key you must copy your public key to the accounts on the remote machines that you want to be able to use.
 Typically you have to copy the public file using the accounts username and password as:
 {{{
MagnusMac-2:~ magnuslarsson$ scp ~/.ssh/id_dsa.pub user@sftpHost:
user@sftpHost's password:
id_dsa.pub                                                        100%  606     0.6KB/s   00:00
 }}}
 Now have to activate the public key by adding it to a list of known public keys.
 This is typically done by logging in to the remote machine and perform the activation by appending the public key to the file {{{~/.ssh/authorized_keys2}}}
 The commands below also create the {{{.ssh}}} folder, assigns correct permissions if not already existing, the same for the {{{~/.ssh/authorized_keys2}}} - file and finally it deletes the public key that no longer is of use.
 {{{
MagnusMac-2:~ magnuslarsson$ ssh user@sftpHost
user@sftpHost's password:
sftpHost:~ user$ mkdir ~/.ssh
sftpHost:~ user$ chmod 700 ~/.ssh
sftpHost:~ user$ cat id_dsa.pub >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys2
sftpHost:~ user$ chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys2
sftpHost:~ user$ rm id_dsa.pub
sftpHost:~ user$ exit
logout
Connection to localhost closed.
MagnusMac-2:~ magnuslarsson$ 
 }}}

 * Validate setup
 It should now be possible to login and start a sftp session to the remote sftp server without specifying any username.
 In the example below we use account {{{muletest1}}} on sftp-server {{{localhost}}}:
 {{{
MagnusMac-2:.ssh magnuslarsson$ ssh muletest1@localhost
Enter passphrase:
Last login: Mon Oct 11 10:55:25 2010 from localhost
MagnusMac-2:~ muletest1$ pwd  
/Users/muletest1
MagnusMac-2:~ muletest1$ exit
logout
Connection to localhost closed.
MagnusMac-2:.ssh magnuslarsson$ 

MagnusMac-2:.ssh magnuslarsson$ sftp muletest1@localhost
Enter passphrase:
Connecting to localhost...
sftp> pwd
Remote working directory: /Users/muletest1
sftp> bye
MagnusMac-2:.ssh magnuslarsson$ 
 }}}


 * Configure default sfpt-settings in soi-toolkit source code generator
 To simplify setup of sftp-configuration in your development environment the soi-toolkit source code generator allows you to specify your favorite sftp-server, your private key location and your passphrase so you don't have to specify it over and over again while you create new sftp-based services and integrations.
 
  * Open Eclipse Preference page in the menu and select the "SOI-Toolkit Generator"
  * Specify the root folder of the sftp server you will use most frequently during development
  E.g. {{{muletest1@localhost/~/sftp}}}
  * Specify the name of your private key
  E.g. {{{/Users/magnuslarsson/.ssh/id_dsa}}} 
  * Specify your passphrase for the private key.
  * Click on the "OK" button to conclude the configuration.
