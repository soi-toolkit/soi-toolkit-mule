#summary Tutorial on how to create an one way Service based on the JMS transport.

=Introduction=

This tutorial will help you to get started with a one-way service that consumes a jms message, transform it and produce an outgoing jms message.

The generated code includes error handling that:
 * Automatically reconnects to the JMS Provider after a network failure or problem with the jms provider itself
 * Perform jms receive and jms send operations in one and the same transaction
 * In case of error during processing (e.g. receiving poisoned messages that can't be transformed)
  * Rollback the transaction
  * Sends a error-log-message to the error-log-queue 
  * Removes the poisoned message from the in-queue and puts it on a dead letter queue 
    (with the same name as the input-queue but prefixed with "DLQ.")

*NOTE*: Prerequisites for this tutorial is that the tutorial [TutorialCreateIntegrationComponent Create a new Integration Component] is completed.

=Create a JMS to JMS service=

 * Select the menu "File --> New --> Other" and expand the wizard "SOI Toolkit Code Generator"
 * Select the code generator "Create a new service"

 * Click on the "Next >" button
 * The wizard "SOI Toolkit - Create a new service" opens up
  * Select the message exchange pattern "One Way"
  * Select the inbound transport "JMS"
  * Select the outbound transport "JMS"
  * Select your service project using the "Browse..." button, e.g. "/mySample-services"
  * Set a proper service-name, e.g. mySampleJmsService

 * Click on the "Finish" button
  * The wizard now starts to generate files and refresh the workspace.

 * When the wizard is done you can find the files for your new service in the Eclipse Package Explorer

 * Files of interest:
  * Source folder {{{src/test/java}}}
  A new package is created for the service {{{org.sample.mysample.mysamplejmsservice}}} with two Java-classes.
  {{{MySampleJmsServiceIntegrationTest.java}}} contains some unit tests for the service that you can use as a start.
  {{{MySampleJmsServiceTestReceiver.java}}} contains a teststub receiver that you can use as a start.
  * Source folder {{{src/test/resources}}}
  The folder {{{teststub-services}}} contains the file {{{MySampleJmsService-teststub-service.xml}}} that is a teststub service that you can use as a start.
  * Source folder {{{src/main/java}}}
  A new package is created for the service {{{org.sample.mysample.mysamplejmsservice}}} with one Java-class.
  {{{MySampleJmsServiceTransformer.java}}} contains a sample transformation that you can use as a start.
  * Source folder {{{src/main/resources}}}
  The folder {{{services}}} contains the file {{{MySampleJmsService-service.xml}}} that contains the actual definition of the new service. 

 * Run unit tests
  * Right-click the test-class {{{MySampleJmsServiceIntegrationTest.java}}} and select "Run As" --> "JUnit Test"
  The tests runs and its success are reported in the JUnit view:

  The Console view displays at the same time log-messages from the execution:

  NOTE: Take a look at the unit test code and the transformer code for a better understanding on what is going on :-)

 * Run tests manually
 Sometimes just running unit tests are not sufficient so it is a good idea to know how to perform manual tests locally in your own PC.
  * NOTE: Requires that you have ActiveMQ installed separately and that it is started.
  See [InstallationGuide#Installing_Apache_ActiveMQ installation guide] for instructions.
  * Right-click on the test-server {{{MySampleMuleServer.java}}} in package {{{org/sample/mysample}}} in source folder {{{src/test/java}}} and select "Run As --> Java Application"
  * Go to the url {{{http://localhost:8161/admin/queues.jsp}}} in a web browser.
  * Write at ok test-message (e.g. "AAA") to the in-queue ({{{MYSAMPLE.MYSAMPLEJMSSERVICE.IN.QUEUE}}}) using the ActiveMQ console and watch the console output and the log + out-queue ({{{SOITOOLKIT.LOG.INFO}}} and {{{MYSAMPLE.MYSAMPLEJMSSERVICE.OUT.QUEUE}}})
  * Write a incorrect message (e.g. "ERROR") to the in-queue and review the console + queues.
  * Stop the mule server by giving focus to the console view in Eclipse and pressing the return key.
